# Module_1
Week 1 homework

1. Fork this repository.
2. Using eslint, create an .eslintrc file that includes rules for the following:
  a. 
3. Lint the map-utils.js file and make the corrections necessary for eslint to verify it is clean.
4. Commit (and push) your changes, which should include map-utils.js with your modifications, and a .eslintrc file, then initiate a pull request with the original, JSCRIPT300-Spring2016/Module_1 repository.
5. If you have successfully created the .eslintrc file and corrected the map-utils.js, I will reply with a :+1:. Otherwise I will leave comments in the pull request indicating what still needs correction. You can re-submit the work again through another commit/push/pull request. If you don't wish to do so but instead just want the work graded as is, leave a comment stating such.
6. I will close the pull request either once I've added the :+1: or you've indicated you're done working on it.
